Now that we're reading frames, and can do input, we're back on the task of trying to do some self-driving. In order to do this, a common goal is to be able to detect lanes. We can use lane detection to both create a self-driving AI that works based on simple rules based on these lanes and also to train an AI that we hope could later generalize to more scenarios.
